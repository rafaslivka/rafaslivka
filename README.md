Hi! my name is Rafael Slivka, currently, i am employed at ADS Solution LTDA, an industrial automation and robotics company, where I serve as the Quality Management System Coordinator and ISO Coordinator. My professional background started in logistics, where I accumulated nine years of experience. I even pursued a semester of studies in logistics at FATEC. While I enjoyed the course, I eventually found myself feeling saturated with logistics work. 

Outside of work, I am fluent in English and have a passion for rock music. I enjoy playing instruments such as the guitar and drums. On weekends, I prioritize spending time with my girlfriend and family.
